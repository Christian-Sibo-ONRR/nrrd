# National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund

Congress created the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund (NPPLLRF) in 2020 through the [Great American Outdoors Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1957). The fund must be used for deferred maintenance projects on federal and Native American lands. The NPPLLRF is funded through energy development revenues for oil, gas, coal, or renewable energy development on federal lands and waters. <br /><br />

The NPPLLRF provides funds to reduce the backlog of deferred maintenance projects in systems administered by:
- the National Park Service,
- the Forest Service,
- the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
- the Bureau of Land Management, and
- the Bureau of Indian Education

## Authorization and funding

On August 4, 2020, the President signed the Great American Outdoors Act creating the NPPLLRF. The fund doesn't receive any tax revenue but is instead funded by energy development revenues on federal lands and waters. For <GlossaryTerm>Fiscal Year (FY)</GlossaryTerm> 2021 through 2025, the NPPLLRF will receive 50% of <GlossaryTerm>miscellaneous receipts</GlossaryTerm> from federal energy development revenues, with a maximum of $1.9 billion deposited to the fund each year. This does not impact funds that Congress has otherwise <GlossaryTerm>appropriated</GlossaryTerm> or disbursements dedicated to other specific funds such as the [Land and Water Conservation Fund](../lwcf). In the beginning of each fiscal year, beginning with 2021, the Department of the Interior calculates the total of energy development miscellaneous receipts for the previous fiscal year. The U.S. Treasury then transfers up to 50% of that total to the NPPLLRF. In FY 2021, the NPPLLRF received the maximum $1.9 billion. <br />

## Use of funds
The NPPLLRF will be used to address deferred maintenance, or address related infrastructure deficiencies, of assets managed by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture. The Secretaries of those departments must prioritize projects to be funded and provide the list of projects to Congress annually. The fund will be allocated to projects as follows:
- 70% to the National Park Service
- 15% to the Forest Service
- 5% to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
- 5% to the Bureau of Land Management
- 5% to the Bureau of Indian Education

The Department of the Interior has a list of [FY 2021 projects](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/doi-fy21-gaoa-dm-projects.pdf) that the NPPLLRF will fund. The National Park Service also has an [inventory of deferred maintainence projects by park throughout its system](https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/589145f1-b816-483f-983f-676296f8f8a1/original). These projects are potentially eligible for NPPLLRF funds.

The U.S. Forest Service also provides a lits of [FY 2021 deferred maintenance projects](https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/GAOA-DM-Project-List-11092020.pdf) as well as [projects proposed for 2022](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/gaoa).
