# Purpose

This directory contains all the result files that are used in the useStaticQuery mocks.

# How to use

One way of easily adding data to the a result file is to copy and paste a console log output from the browser. Export the default object. The file will automatically be imported by the mock useStaticQuery function in the \__mocks__/gatsby.js file.

## Naming convention
The name should use the name of the query followed by '_results.json'.
