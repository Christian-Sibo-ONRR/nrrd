## Scope

These datasets include natural resource revenue for Native American lands. The datasets include data tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue. [Learn more about Native American ownership and governance of natural resources](/how-it-works/native-american-ownership-governance/).

<h3 alt="Negative values">Why are some values negative?</h3>

Payments can be adjusted for up to seven years after a transaction takes place. If a company overpays their royalty, rent, or bonus, they are entitled to recoup their overpayment. If the overpayment and recoupment happen in different years, the recoupment will appear as a negative amount in the Office of Natural Resources Revenue's revenue summaries.

<h3 alt="Oil and gas values">Why is there a Gas value, an Oil value and an Oil & Gas value?</h3>

At the time of lease sale, it isn’t known whether a lease will produce oil, gas, or both oil and gas. After a lease starts producing a commodity (or commodities), the lease owner starts paying royalties. These can then be associated with either oil or gas. Hence, rent and bonus lines of data will be associated with an “Oil & Gas” commodity type, while royalty lines of data will be associated with either “Oil” or “Gas” commodity types.

### Fields and definitions

_Revenue Type_ Revenues from natural resources fall into one of several types:

* _Bonus_ The amount paid by the highest successful bidder for a natural resource lease. The winning bid.
* _Rents_ A natural resource lease might not produce anything in paying quantities for some time after it is sold. Until it does, periodic payments are made for the right to continue exploration and development of the land for future natural resource production. These payments are called rent.
* _Royalties_ A natural resource lease holder pays royalties after the lease starts producing a commodity in <glossary-term>paying quantities</glossary-term>. The amount is based on a percentage of the revenue from the commodity sold. The exact percentage is set in the original lease document that went along with the lease sale.
* _Other Revenues_ This category includes revenues that are not included in the royalty, rent, or bonus categories, such as minimum royalties, estimated royalties, settlement agreements, and interest.

_Mineral Lease Type_ There are three fields in this dataset that show the natural resource that produced the revenue. “Mineral Lease Type” is the most general field, used to record the broad category of natural resources sought. “Oil” and “Gas” are combined here, because at the outset of the lease, it is unknown if the lease will produce oil, gas, or both.

_Commodity_ This describes the commodity sought or produced. For instance, a lease operator may explore for oil and gas, but this column shows what the lease actually produced (if the revenue type is “Royalties”).

_Product_ The most detailed field for the natural resources produced, the Product field shows the specific natural resource for which revenue was collected. For example, the product level lists what type “Oil” was produced, such as “Fuel Oil” or “Condensate”, among others. Since the product is what is actually produced from the lease, products will show up mostly for the “Royalties” revenue type.

_Revenue_ Total revenue.
