# Properties:

**Path to file:** Link/Link.js

This Link component includes logic to determine if we need to use the Gatsby Link. By using Gatsby Link we leverage the internal routing table and the ability to prefetch relative links. By default all relative urls will use Gatsby, however files that need to be downloaded or anchor links do not use Gatsby Link.
We also determine a link type by default to assign the appropriate icon.

```live
<Link>Link</Link>
```
