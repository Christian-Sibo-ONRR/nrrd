# How Revenue Works

In the U.S., land and the resources beneath it can be owned by private individuals and corporations or by federal, state, local, and Native American governments. This makes the U.S. different from nearly every other country; in many places oil, gas, coal, and other minerals simply belong to the government, but in the U.S. there is widespread private ownership of these resources.

---

### Federal laws and regulations
The legislative branch has passed many laws governing natural resource extraction on federal lands.

[Learn about federal laws](/how-revenue-works/federal-laws/)

### Federal reforms
The government reforms laws and regulations by enacting new legislation and proposing new rules for implementation.
